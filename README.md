The Patient Health Record Management system is designed to revolutionize healthcare information management by establishing a centralized and secure platform for Electronic Health Records (EHR). This comprehensive system aims to elevate patient care through efficient data management, providing healthcare providers with quick and secure access to critical health information. 
       By consolidating patient records in a centralized repository, the system facilitates streamlined data management, ensuring that medical histories, treatment records, test results, and prescriptions are easily accessible and accurately documented. The goal is to empower healthcare professionals with timely and comprehensive insights into a patient's health journey, fostering informed decision-making and personalized care delivery.
